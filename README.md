# Smart Contracts Scaffolding
Figuring out how to scaffold Smart Contracts without a framework. Includes compile and testing. The main library being used to facilitate all this is Sulk. I currently prefer this over Truffle or Embark since it allows for flexibility of testing environment and putting your contracts into a separate module.
